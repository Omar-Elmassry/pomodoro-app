## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Types for JS
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For managing forms
- Web workers

### Continued development

I might redo all the state part with some state manger eg: zustand or joti

### Useful resources

- [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) - This helped me manage my set intervals when chrome tab is not active.
